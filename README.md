# Prime Number Checker (C & Python)

This repository contains simple and clean implementations of a **Prime Number Checker** using **C** and **Python**.  
The programs read an integer from the user and determine whether the number is **prime** or **not prime**.

## What is a Prime Number?

A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has **exactly two distinct divisors**:
- 1
- Itself

Examples:
- Prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13
- Not prime numbers: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10

## Algorithm Description

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Read an integer number from the user.
2. If the number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime.
3. Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.
4. If any divisor is found, the number is not prime.
5. If no divisor is found, the number is prime.

This method is efficient and commonly used in practice.
